# 🧠 Insight Viewer

**Insight Viewer** is a responsive and dynamic web application for displaying time-stamped market analyses in a clean, card-based layout. Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it loads data from a JSON file and offers paginated, responsive viewing across devices.

This project demonstrates frontend skills such as responsive design, client-side data rendering, dynamic routing via query strings, and time-relative formatting — all without requiring a backend.
